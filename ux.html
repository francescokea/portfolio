        Understanding UX design it means trying to look at the digital product we publish from a consumer-point-of-view.
        It's a process that requires different phases and skills. We have to follow strict rules sometimes and at the same time trying to be original in the design process last but not least we also have to think about our user and his necessities, who and how will he come in contact with our products?
        Different users mean different cultures, different approach to using the same product, problem but it also means different capabilities, hence we must think about accessibility which is already a really big discipline, itself.
        Here I provide a project on the practical study of UX in a Mobile Web App to be used to buy LP from the '80s.
        In this page, you will also find a link to an article from my blog, in which I discuss with my self about UI and UX and their importance in these recent times.</p>
